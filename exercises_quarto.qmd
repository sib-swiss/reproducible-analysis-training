## Learning outcomes

**After finishing this chapter you will be able to:**

-   Create a quarto project with RStudio

-   Locally render and view a quarto website

-   Add markdown content to a quarto document

-   Add and execute code chunks to a quarto document

-   Add and modify code-chunk options

-   Execute code chunks that create figures and create cross references to them
:::

## Initiate a website project

We'll start with creating a website project. In Rstudio:

-   Choose **File** \> **New Project..**

-   Choose **New Directory**

-   Choose **Quarto website**

-   Choose a location and name for the website. Leave **Create a git repository** checked

-   Finish by pushing the button **Create Project**

![](img/create_project.gif)

Now we have created a template for a quarto website 👏 . It doesn't contain much, but we can already render it and use it as a functional website. In order to view it locally in your browser you can either:

-   Open `index.qmd` in Rstudio and press the button **Render**

-   Or you can use the **Terminal** and type:

``` bash
quarto preview
```

In both cases your computer will open a browser and locally host the page at a random port.

## Adding content

### Adding text

In this part, we will use quarto to display our project goals. In `index.qmd`, create an introduction where you will state:

*In this project we aim to visualize the trends of the most frequently used babynames from 1880 to 2017 in the United States. We do this by:*

-   *Understanding the different columns of the data set*
-   *Find the top 10 most frequently used baby names in the data for:*
    -   *girls*
    -   *boys*
-   *Plot the yearly trend of the top 10 baby names*

## Exercise

Take the above introduction of your `babynames` project, convert it to markdown text, and add it to `index.qmd`.

## Answer

This is what your `index.qmd` could look like:

``` markdown

In this project we aim to visualize the trends of the most frequently used babynames from 1880 to 2017 in the United States. We do this by:

- Understanding the different columns of the data set
- Find the top 10 most frequently used baby names in the data for:
   - girls
   - boys
- Plot the yearly trend of the top 10 baby names 
```

### Adding an image

You can add images with the following syntax:

``` markdown
![image_alt_text](path/or/url/to/image.png)
```

::: callout-important
## Exercise

Check out the [quarto figure guide](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html). Find an image of a baby in the public domain on [creative commons](https://search.creativecommons.org/). Get the full URL of the image and add it to your `index.qmd`. Make it 400 pixels in width and align it to the right side of the page.

### Adding a page

We will now add a page for the analysis. We do this by clicking in Rstudio **File** \> **New File..** \> **Quarto Document..**. Choose a title, e.g. `analysis` and press **Create**. Save the newly created file as `analysis.qmd`.

In order to make our new page part of the website, we have to edit `_quarto.yml`. By adding it to the `navbar` item in the `website` markup:

``` yml
website:
  title: "quarto-tutorial"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - about.qmd
      - analysis.qmd
```

### Adding code chunks

We can add some code in there. First, we add a chunk that loads the libraries:

```` markdown
```{{r}}
library(babynames)
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```
````

### Plotting and cross-referencing

To plot the first 10 lines of the babynames table you can add:

```` markdown
```{{r}}
head(babynames) |> kable()
```
````

::: callout-important
## Exercise

Add the two above code as an R code chunk to `analysis.qmd`, and do the following:

-   add some text to let the reader know what it does
-   suppress the package startup messages with `#| output: false` at the top of the chunk that loads the packages. More info about the hash-pipe [here](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-knitr.html)
-   re-render the site.

## Answer

title: "Analysis"

First we load the packages:

```{{r}}
#| output: false
library(babynames)
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

The first ten lines of the babynames dataset looks like:


```{{r}}
head(babynames) |> kable()
```
````

Here, I've created two functions that do the following:

-   `get_most_frequent`: Gets the most frequent babynames over a time-period.
-   `plot_top`: from the output of `get_most_frequent`. Plot the top n most popular names.

::: callout-note
This is not a coding tutorial, so you can ignore the code itself. Just know what is does.
:::

``` r
get_most_frequent <- function(babynames, select_sex, from = 1950) {
  most_freq <- babynames |>
    filter(sex == select_sex, year > from) |>
    group_by(name) |>
    summarise(average = mean(prop)) |>
    arrange(desc(average))
  return(most_freq)
}

plot_top <- function(x, babynames, select_sex, top = 10, from = 1950) {
  topx <- x$name[1:top]
  
  p <- babynames |>
    filter(name %in% topx, sex == select_sex, year > from) |>
    ggplot(aes(x = year, y = prop, color = name)) +
    geom_line() +
    scale_color_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
    theme_classic()
  
  return(p)
}
```

Plotting them for girls like this:

``` r
get_most_frequent(babynames, select_sex = "F") |>
  plot_top(babynames, select_sex = "F", top = 10)
```

Plotting them for boys like this:

``` r
get_most_frequent(babynames, select_sex = "M") |>
  plot_top(babynames, select_sex = "M", top = 10)
```

## Exercise

Add the above three code chunks to `analysis.qmd`, and do the following:

-   Since the functions are a bit bulky we want to make the chunk foldable. Do this by `#| code-fold: true`
-   Describe in a text what you see in the figures. Refer to the individual figures in text by [cross-referencing](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html#cross-references).\

## Answer

```` markdown
To create a visualization of the most popular baby names, we have created two functions. Click the 'Code' link to view:

```{{r}}
#| code-fold: true
get_most_frequent <- function(babynames, select_sex, from = 1950) {
  most_freq <- babynames |>
    filter(sex == select_sex, year > from) |>
    group_by(name) |>
    summarise(average = mean(prop)) |>
    arrange(desc(average))
  return(most_freq)
}

plot_top <- function(x, babynames, select_sex, top = 10, from = 1950) {
  topx <- x$name[1:top]
  
  p <- babynames |>
    filter(name %in% topx, sex == select_sex, year > from) |>
    ggplot(aes(x = year, y = prop, color = name)) +
    geom_line() +
    scale_color_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
    theme_classic()
  
  return(p)
}
```

Here we call the code to visualize the top 10 most frequent girl names from 1950 onwards:


```{{r}}
#| label: fig-line-girls
#| fig-cap: "Line plot displaying proportion of top 10 girl names by year"
get_most_frequent(babynames, select_sex = "F") |>
  plot_top(babynames, select_sex = "F", top = 10)
```
    
In @fig-line-girls you can see that there has been a peak in popularity for 'Lisa', 'Jennifer' and 'Jessica'. Interesting! Let's have a look at the boys names:

```{{r}}
#| label: fig-line-boys
#| fig-cap: "Line plot displaying proportion of top 10 boy names by year"
most_freq_boys <- get_most_frequent(babynames, select_sex = "M")
plot_top(most_freq_boys, babynames, select_sex = "M", top = 10)
```

@fig-line-boys shows that names that were popular before 1990 are relatively infrequent after 2000.
