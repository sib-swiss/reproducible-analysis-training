    "text": "Course description\nThe FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) principles provide guidelines for making research data and other resources more easily discoverable and reusable, which can help increase your research’s impact and exposure. Adhering to these principles also ensures that your research is more reliable and reproducible, as others can more easily access and provide feedback. In addition, making your research FAIR can promote the principles of open science and make it easier for others to contribute to and build upon your work. Finally, many funding agencies and journals now expect that your research outputs be made FAIR as a condition of funding or publication, so adhering to these principles can help to ensure that your research meets these requirements.\nSharing and reusing are at the heart of the FAIR principles and should be a routine task of any (life) scientist today. To enable others to use or reproduce our findings and work, we need to provide all the information: the data, software and parameters used, scripts for the analysis, databases and their versions, and any required documentation and contextualisation. To have all this information and code together in a single file, many use markdown. Such a markdown file can be created in a simple way, and after that rendered in a single web page that is easy to share and read.\nThe FAIR principles are a continuum of steps, and FAIRrer research is better than not FAIR at all. In this tutorial, the participants will be introduced to some FAIR steps. They will learn how to write documentation containing Markdown and code (e.g. R or Python) and render it into nicely formatted pages with Quarto. Afterwards, the participants will learn the basics of git and GitHub and how to host the version-controlled source files in a GitHub repository. Third, the participants will learn how to automatically render the source files into a nicely formatted web page hosted with GitHub. Lastly, the participant will learn how to store the source files in a longer term by linking a GitHub repository to Zenodo and giving it a unique identifier (DOI).\nBy using the taught tools and concepts, the participants will take significant steps in adhering to the FAIR principles and therefore boost the benefits of sharing."

Consider adding attributes specified here. After that, add it to the repository, commit the change and push it to the remote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nModify the .zenodo.json file and add it to the repo. Stage, commit and push like so:\ngit add .zenodo.json\ngit commit -m \"adds .zenodo.json file\"\ngit push\n\n\n\nNow that we have added metadata to the repository, we can link our repository to Zenodo:\n\nBrowse to zenodo.org and sign up by using your GitHub account.\nOn the top right, click the drop-down menu and select GitHub.\nAll the public repositories in your namespace are in the list. Move the switch at the repository you have just created.\nNow, go to your repository on GitHub and create a release. Do this by selecting Create a new release on the right side.\nChoose a tag that starts with v and follows the rules of semantic versioning, so a good first name would be e.g. v1.0.0.\nChoose a release title. This can be anything.\nClick the green button Publish release\nGo back to the GitHub page on Zenodo and click Sync now at the top right.\nThere should now be a green bar at your repository, and it received a DOI. You can check out the record by clicking on the repository name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nOff course we want to show off with the DOI we just assigned. In order to do that:\n\nClick the DOI badge. A window will appear with code chunks that you can use to display the badge.\nCopy-paste the markdown syntax to your main page (index.qmd) to show it on your website.\nStage, commit and push the change. After that, render and publish the website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of the top of index.qmd:\n---\ntitle: \"quarto-tutorial\"\n---\n\n[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/657627364.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/657627364)\nAfter that, we run the commands:\ngit add index.qmd\ngit commit -m \"Adds a badge to the website\"\ngit push\nAnd the quarto commands (not required if you’ve set up the action!):\nquarto render\nquarto publish gh-pages"

We could do that one-by-one by typing e.g. git add index.qmd, git add _quarto.yml and so on. However, to stage all changed and untracked files we can use:\ngit add --all\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStaging convenience\n\n\n\nIf you want to check beforehand what you will stage, you can do a ‘dry run’ with:\ngit add --all -n\nIf you made a mistake and want to unstage a file that is not tracked yet, you can run:\ngit rm --cached file.txt\nIf the file is tracked (i.e. you have committed changes before), you can use:\ngit restore --staged file.txt\n\n\nThe command git status will now return all files in green, which means that they are staged. The next step will be the commit itself:\ngit commit -m \"first commit\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe more descriptive you make your commits, the easier it is to find back a commit. It is generally advised to write in a tense that describes what the commit does, so e.g.\n\nFixes bug\nAdds image to main page\nAdds gene expression heatmap"

If you haven’t setup a PAT yet, follow the instructions here as stated in the course preparations.\n\n\nWe will now link our local repository to a remote repository on GitHub. First, we need to create an empty repository on GitHub. Do this by:\n\nNavigating to the GitHub website and login\nClick the + sign at the top right and click New repository\nFill out the form:\n\nChoose a repository name. Typically this is the same name as your project directory\nWe will host a website, so make sure it’s public\nLeave the rest unchecked, so no README file and no .gitignore (we’ll leave the README.md for now, and .gitignore is already in our local repository)\n\nClick the green button with Create repository\n\nAfter you have created the empty repository, GitHub is already giving you suggestions what to do. We have already created the commit, and our current branch is the main branch (check it with git branch).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nIf running git branch does not return main (if so, it’s likely to return master), change the branch name with:\ngit branch -m main\n\n\nTo make a new connection called origin between the local and remote repositories we run:\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/USER/REPOSITORY.git\nAfter that, we’ll synchronize with the remote repository with:\ngit push -u origin main\nWhich pushes the main branch from the local repository to the remote (named origin). The option -u makes sure that the main branch is used as default branch on the remote repository. Now you can check whether your local repository is synced with the remote by refreshing the repository page in your browser. The files you have committed should appear.\nNow we can publish our site. To do this, you only need to run one command:\nquarto publish gh-pages\nThis command will:\n\nCreate a branch named gh-pages (if it doesn’t exist)\nPush the website files to gh-pages\nChange the settings in your GitHub repository to tell that the website files will be in gh-pages\n\n🤝 congrats! You’ve just published your first website with an analysis report! Find it at USER.github.io/REPO."

    "text": "Creating a branch and pull request to add a figure panel\nLet’s add a feature to our website: we will add a sub-chapter where we create a panel of multiple figures and cross reference them in the text. It is important that we don’t interfere with the main branch while we are developing it.\n\nFrom issue to branch\nWhen adding a new feature, a good practice would be to first write an issue. Here you describe clearly what you want to do. With an issue, it is straightforward to discuss about it, maintain a backlog, and give it a priority. At the point you decide you will work on the issue, you can make a branch out of the issue. In this way the branch has a clear aim - described in the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nGo to your repository on GitHub. Write an issue (Click the Issues tab) with the following content:\nTitle: Create a panel of figures\nDescription:\nThe figure panel should contain:\n\nLine plot of top 5 girl names from 2010 onwards\nLine plot of top 10 girl names from 2010 onwards\nHeatmap of top 30 girl names from 2010 onwards\n\nDescribe and cross-reference the individual figures in the text\nAfter that, save the issue, and at the issue page, on the right panel click on Create a branch under Development. This will automatically suggest a good branch name. Use the default settings and click Create branch. GitHub will automatically suggest what code to run to work on the branch locally. This will be:\ngit fetch origin\ngit checkout 1-create-a-panel-of-figures\nRun these commands in your local terminal at the root directory of your quarto project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can validate whether you are in the right branch by typing:\ngit branch\nThe branch 1-create-a-panel-of-figures should appear in green.\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a figure panel\nNice! Now we have a new branch so we can develop in our repository without interfering with our stable main branch. Let’s work on the issue. To create the three figures that you just described in the issue, the required code will be provided by us. Your job would be to add hash-pipe (i.e. #|) options to the code chunk to render the plots as we want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nCheck out the quarto documentation on computed figures and cross-referencing and custom layout.\nThe code below will create the three figures that are displayed in two rows:\n\nThe two line graphs: should be in the first row, and next to each other\nThe heatmap: should be in the second row and span the entire column.\n\nUse this code and add the required chunk options:\n```{r}\n# get most frequent girl names from 2010 onwards\nfrom_year &lt;- 2010\nmost_freq_girls &lt;- get_most_frequent(babynames, select_sex = \"F\",\n                                     from = from_year)\n\n# plot top 5 girl names\nmost_freq_girls |&gt;\n  plot_top(top = 5)\n\n# plot top 10 girl names\nmost_freq_girls |&gt;\n  plot_top(top = 10)\n\n# get top 30 girl names in a matrix\n# with names in rows and years in columns\nprop_df &lt;- babynames |&gt; \n  filter(name %in% most_freq_girls$most_frequent$name[1:30] & sex == \"F\") |&gt;\n  filter(year &gt;= from_year) |&gt; \n  select(year, name, prop) |&gt;\n  pivot_wider(names_from = year,\n              values_from = prop)\n\nprop_mat &lt;- as.matrix(prop_df[, 2:ncol(prop_df)])\nrownames(prop_mat) &lt;- prop_df$name\n\n# create heatmap\npheatmap(prop_mat, cluster_cols = FALSE, scale = \"row\")\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd the following to the top of the code chunk:\n#| label: fig-line-2010\n#| layout: [[50,50], [100]]\n#| fig-cap: \"Most popular girl names from 2010 onwards\"\n#| fig-subcap: \n#|   - \"Top 5\"\n#|   - \"Top 10\"\n#|   - \"Top 30\"\nYou can refer to the figures in the markdown text like this:\nIn @fig-line-2010-1 and @fig-line-2010-1 the line plots are shown. To view trends of many names at once, @fig-line-2010-3 displays a heatmap.\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a pull request\nIf the panel is appearing as it should, it might be time to merge it to the main branch. For this we’d first need to commit our changes:\ngit add analysis.qmd\ngit commit -m \"adds the figure panel\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNow, we could merge by (do not run this now!):\n# go to the main branch\ngit checkout main\n# merge the development branch to the main branch\ngit merge 1-create-a-panel-of-figures\n\n\nAs shown above, we could directly merge our development branch locally. However, if we are working with multiple people on the same project, we want to be explicit that we want to perform this merge. For example, you might want your colleague to test/review your change before merging. The way to do this would be by a pull request.\nTo create a pull request we first need to push our changes to the remote repository:\n# make sure you are on the development branch\ngit checkout 1-create-a-panel-of-figures\n# push the changes to the remote repository\ngit push\nNow browse to the repository on GitHub. You will already see a yellow banner with the question whether you want to create a pull request. However, we will do it in a more explicit way. Go to the tab Pull requests. Click the button New pull request. As base specify the main branch. At compare specify 1-create-a-panel-of-figures. Now review the displayed changes and click the button Create pull request. Add comments if necessary. In the same page, you can specify reviewers and assignees if you want others to become involved. We skip this for now, and click Merge pull request to merge 1-create-a-panel-of-figures to main.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the issue. Has anything happened to it?\nSwitch to the main branch locally and pull the changes your local repository\nValidate whether the development branch is merged to main\nCheck out the commits with git log --oneline. Anything changed in the commit history?\nRe-publish the website\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe issue should be marked as ‘Closed’. This has happened automatically after merging the pull request, because GitHub created a reference between the issue and the branch.\nTo switch to main and pull the changes:\ngit checkout main\ngit pull\nNow the code with the figure panel should be added to analysis.qmd. If you run git log --oneline you will see that the merge is stored as a commit, looking something like this:\n4fdf90e Merge pull request #1 from yourusername/1-create-a-panel-of-figures\nTo publish\nquarto publish gh-pages"

    "section": "[Extra] render with GitHub actions",
    "text": "[Extra] render with GitHub actions\nWouldn’t it be nice if the website would be updated automatically when we push changes to the main branch? This can be done with GitHub actions. GitHub actions are a set of jobs that run after certain changes (triggers) to your repository. For example, you can run a job after you push to a specific branch. In this case, we want to render the website after a push to the main branch.\n\nSet up renv\nIn order to render the website as a github action, we need to define the R package dependencies that are required to run the code. For us, that would be among others ggplot, pheatmap, babynames and others. To conveniently handle this, we use the package renv, which basically looks for packages you are using in your project and creates an environment definition file (called renv.lock) based on which packages it finds.\nTo set up renv for you project, run the following:\ninstall.packages(\"renv\")\nrenv::init()\nrenv::snapshot()\nHere, init will initiate renv in your project by creating the required files, among which renv.lock. The function snapshot will create a snapshot of your current project dependencies and add it to renv.lock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nAfter running renv::init() and renv::snapshot() see what is in renv.lock and commit the changes of your repository to the main branch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe file renv.lock is a json file containing all package metadata. To add it to your repository:\ngit checkout main\ngit add --all\ngit commit -m \"set up renv\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDefine the GitHub action\nNow that we have defined the required dependencies, we can define the action. We will provide you with a template for this:\nname: Quarto Publish\n\n# the on statement tells github actions whnen to run the action\non:\n  # pushing to main\n  push:\n    branches: main\n    \n# set permissions so the actions in the workflow can write files to your repository\npermissions: write-all\n\n# define the job\njobs:\n  # we name it quarto-deploy\n  quarto-deploy:\n    # define the virtual environment\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    # the steps are the individual actions that are needed to complete the job\n\n    steps:\n        \n        # first step is check out the repository so we have access to the files\n        # inside the repository in our virtual environment\n      - name: Check out repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n        \n        # now we install quarto in the environment\n      - name: Set up Quarto\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2\n        \n        # we also install R\n      - name: Install R\n        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2\n        with:\n          # ! important: change this version to your local R version \n          # i.e. the version that is specified in renv.lock\n          r-version: '4.3.1'\n\n        # and the required R dependencies\n      - name: Install R Dependencies\n        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-renv@v2\n        with:\n          cache-version: 1\n\n        # now we use a pre-created action to basically run \n        # quarto publish gh-pages\n      - name: Render and Publish\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2\n        with:\n          target: gh-pages\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\nCompare the version of R that is installed on your local machine with the one specified in the yaml file. Update it to the version that you have locally installed (and is specified in renv.lock). Store the file in your repository as .github/workflows/quarto-publish.yml. Also add and commit this file to you repository with:\ngit add .github/workflows/quarto-publish.yml\ngit commit -m \"adds action yaml\"\nNow, we’re ready to push and with that trigger the run of our first action. Go ahead and push the commits to remote repository with:\ngit push\nAfter pushing, go to the Actions tab in your repository on GitHub. You should see a new action running named ‘Quarto Publish’. After it finishes, you can check out the rendered website, which will be hosted on USER.github.io/REPOSITORY.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis will take a while, because all packages need to be compiled.\n\n\nFrom now on, every time you push to main, the action will run and the website will be updated."

We do this by clicking in Rstudio File &gt; New File.. &gt; Quarto Document... Choose a title, e.g. analysis and press Create. Save the newly created file as analysis.qmd.\nIn order to make our new page part of the website, we have to edit _quarto.yml.

First, we add a chunk that loads the libraries:\n```{r}\nlibrary(babynames)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(pheatmap)\n```\n\n\nPlotting and cross-referencing\nTo display the first 10 lines of the babynames table you can add:\n```{r}\nhead(babynames) |&gt; kable()\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nAdd the two above code chunks as an R code chunk to analysis.qmd, and do the following:\n\nadd some text to let the reader know what it does\nsuppress the package startup messages with #| output: false at the top of the chunk that loads the packages. More info about the hash-pipe here\nre-render the site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"Analysis\"\n---\n\nFirst we load the packages:\n\n```{r}\n#| output: false\nlibrary(babynames)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(pheatmap)\n```\n\nThe first ten lines of the babynames dataset looks like:\n\n\n```{r}\nhead(babynames) |&gt; kable()\n```\n\n\n\nHere, I’ve created two functions that do the following:\n\nget_most_frequent: Gets the most frequent babynames over a time-period.\nplot_top: from the output of get_most_frequent. Plot the top n most popular names.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis is not a coding tutorial, so you can ignore the code itself.

Do this by #| code-fold: true\nDescribe in a text what you see in the figures. Refer to the individual figures in text by cross-referencing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create a visualization of the most popular baby names, we have created two functions. Click the 'Code' link to view:\n\n```{r}\n#| code-fold: true\nget_most_frequent &lt;- function(babynames, select_sex, from = 1950) {\n  most_freq &lt;- babynames |&gt;\n    filter(sex == select_sex, year &gt; from) |&gt;\n    group_by(name) |&gt;\n    summarise(average = mean(prop)) |&gt;\n    arrange(desc(average))\n    \n  return(list(\n    babynames = babynames,\n    most_frequent = most_freq,\n    sex = select_sex,\n    from = from))\n}\n\nplot_top &lt;- function(x, top = 10) {\n  topx &lt;- x$most_frequent$name[1:top]\n  \n  p &lt;- x$babynames |&gt;\n    filter(name %in% topx, sex == x$sex, year &gt; x$from) |&gt;\n    ggplot(aes(x = year, y = prop, color = name)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Paired\") +\n    theme_classic()\n  \n  return(p)\n}\n```\n\nHere we call the code to visualize the top 10 most frequent girl names from 1950 onwards:\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-line-girls\n#| fig-cap: \"Line plot displaying proportion of top 10 girl names by year\"\nget_most_frequent(babynames, select_sex = \"F\") |&gt;\n  plot_top()\n```\n    \nIn @fig-line-girls you can see that there has been a peak in popularity for 'Lisa', 'Jennifer' and 'Jessica'. Interesting! Let's have a look at the boys names:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-line-boys\n#| fig-cap: \"Line plot displaying proportion of top 10 boy names by year\"\nget_most_frequent(babynames, select_sex = \"M\") |&gt;\n  plot_top()\n```\n\n@fig-line-boys shows that names that were popular before 1990 are relatively infrequent after 2000."
