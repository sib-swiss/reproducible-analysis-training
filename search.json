If you haven‚Äôt setup a PAT yet, follow the instructions here as stated in the course preparations.\n\n\nWe will now link our local repository to a remote repository on GitHub. First, we need to create an empty repository on GitHub. Do this by:\n\nNavigating to the GitHub website and login\nClick the + sign at the top right and click New repository\nFill out the form:\n\nChoose a repository name. Typically this is the same name as your project directory\nWe will host a website, so make sure it‚Äôs public\nLeave the rest unchecked, so no README file and no .gitignore (we‚Äôll leave the README.md for now, and .gitignore is already in our local repository)\n\nClick the green button with Create repository\n\nAfter you have created the empty repository, GitHub is already giving you suggestions what to do. We have already created the commit, and our current branch is the main branch (check it with git branch).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nIf running git branch does not return main (if so, it‚Äôs likely to return master), change the branch name with:\ngit branch -m main\n\n\nTo make a new connection called origin between the local and remote repositories we run:\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/USER/REPOSITORY.git\nAfter that, we‚Äôll synchronize with the remote repository with:\ngit push -u origin main\nWhich pushes the main branch from the local repository to the remote (named origin). The option -u makes sure that the main branch is used as default branch on the remote repository. Now you can check whether your local repository is synced with the remote by refreshing the repository page in your browser. The files you have committed should appear.\nNow we can publish our site. To do this, you only need to run one command:\nquarto publish gh-pages\nThis command will:\n\nCreate a branch named gh-pages (if it doesn‚Äôt exist)\nPush the website files to gh-pages\nChange the settings in your GitHub repository to tell that the website files will be in gh-pages\n\nü§ù congrats! You‚Äôve just published your first website with an analysis report! Find it at USER.github.io/REPO."

    "text": "Creating a branch and pull request to add a figure panel\nLet‚Äôs add a feature to our website: we will add a sub-chapter where we create a panel of multiple figures and cross reference them in the text. It is important that we don‚Äôt interfere with the main branch while we are developing it.\n\nFrom issue to branch\nWhen adding a new feature, a good practice would be to first write an issue. Here you describe clearly what you want to do. With an issue, it is straightforward to discuss about it, maintain a backlog, and give it a priority. At the point you decide you will work on the issue, you can make a branch out of the issue. In this way the branch has a clear aim - described in the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nGo to your repository on GitHub. Write an issue (Click the Issues tab) with the following content:\nTitle: Create a panel of figures\nDescription:\nThe figure panel should contain:\n\nLine plot of top 5 girl names from 2010 onwards\nLine plot of top 10 girl names from 2010 onwards\nHeatmap of top 30 girl names from 2010 onwards\n\nDescribe and cross-reference the individual figures in the text\nAfter that, save the issue, and at the issue page, on the right panel click on Create a branch under Development. This will automatically suggest a good branch name. Use the default settings and click Create branch. GitHub will automatically suggest what code to run to work on the branch locally. This will be:\ngit fetch origin\ngit checkout 1-create-a-panel-of-figures\nRun these commands in your local terminal at the root directory of your quarto project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can validate whether you are in the right branch by typing:\ngit branch\nThe branch 1-create-a-panel-of-figures should appear in green.\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a figure panel\nNice! Now we have a new branch so we can develop in our repository without interfering with our stable main branch. Let‚Äôs work on the issue. To create the three figures that you just described in the issue, the required code will be provided by us. Your job would be to add hash-pipe (i.e.¬†#|) options to the code chunk to render the plots as we want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nCheck out the quarto documentation on computed figures and cross-referencing and custom layout.\nThe code below will create the three figures that are displayed in two rows:\n\nThe two line graphs: should be in the first row, and next to each other\nThe heatmap: should be in the second row and span the entire column.\n\nUse this code and add the required chunk options:\n```{r}\n# get most frequent girl names from 2010 onwards\nfrom_year &lt;- 2010\nmost_freq_girls &lt;- get_most_frequent(babynames, select_sex = \"F\",\n                                     from = from_year)\n\n# plot top 5 girl names\nmost_freq_girls |&gt;\n  plot_top(top = 5)\n\n# plot top 10 girl names\nmost_freq_girls |&gt;\n  plot_top(top = 10)\n\n# get top 30 girl names in a matrix\n# with names in rows and years in columns\nprop_df &lt;- babynames |&gt; \n  filter(name %in% most_freq_girls$most_frequent$name[1:30] & sex == \"F\") |&gt;\n  filter(year &gt;= from_year) |&gt; \n  select(year, name, prop) |&gt;\n  pivot_wider(names_from = year,\n              values_from = prop)\n\nprop_mat &lt;- as.matrix(prop_df[, 2:ncol(prop_df)])\nrownames(prop_mat) &lt;- prop_df$name\n\n# create heatmap\npheatmap(prop_mat, cluster_cols = FALSE, scale = \"row\")\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd the following to the top of the code chunk:\n#| label: fig-line-2010\n#| layout: [[50,50], [100]]\n#| fig-cap: \"Most popular girl names from 2010 onwards\"\n#| fig-subcap: \n#|   - \"Top 5\"\n#|   - \"Top 10\"\n#|   - \"Top 30\"\nYou can refer to the figures in the markdown text like this:\nIn @fig-line-2010-1 and @fig-line-2010-1 the line plots are shown. To view trends of many names at once, @fig-line-2010-3 displays a heatmap.\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a pull request\nIf the panel is appearing as it should, it might be time to merge it to the main branch. For this we‚Äôd first need to commit our changes:\ngit add analysis.qmd\ngit commit -m \"adds the figure panel\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNow, we could merge by (do not run this now!):\n# go to the main branch\ngit checkout main\n# merge the development branch to the main branch\ngit merge 1-create-a-panel-of-figures\n\n\nAs shown above, we could directly merge our development branch locally. However, if we are working with multiple people on the same project, we want to be explicit that we want to perform this merge. For example, you might want your colleague to test/review your change before merging. The way to do this would be by a pull request.\nTo create a pull request we first need to push our changes to the remote repository:\n# make sure you are on the development branch\ngit checkout 1-create-a-panel-of-figures\n# push the changes to the remote repository\ngit push\nNow browse to the repository on GitHub. You will already see a yellow banner with the question whether you want to create a pull request. However, we will do it in a more explicit way. Go to the tab Pull requests. Click the button New pull request. As base specify the main branch. At compare specify 1-create-a-panel-of-figures. Now review the displayed changes and click the button Create pull request. Add comments if necessary. In the same page, you can specify reviewers and assignees if you want others to become involved. We skip this for now, and click Merge pull request to merge 1-create-a-panel-of-figures to main.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the issue. Has anything happened to it?\nSwitch to the main branch locally and pull the changes your local repository\nValidate whether the development branch is merged to main\nCheck out the commits with git log --oneline. Anything changed in the commit history?\nRe-publish the website\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe issue should be marked as ‚ÄòClosed‚Äô. This has happened automatically after merging the pull request, because GitHub created a reference between the issue and the branch.\nTo switch to main and pull the changes:\ngit checkout main\ngit pull\nNow the code with the figure panel should be added to analysis.qmd. If you run git log --oneline you will see that the merge is stored as a commit, looking something like this:\n4fdf90e Merge pull request #1 from yourusername/1-create-a-panel-of-figures\nTo publish\nquarto publish gh-pages"

    "section": "[Extra] render with GitHub actions",
    "text": "[Extra] render with GitHub actions\nWouldn‚Äôt it be nice if the website would be updated automatically when we push changes to the main branch? This can be done with GitHub actions. GitHub actions are a set of jobs that run after certain changes (triggers) to your repository. For example, you can run a job after you push to a specific branch. In this case, we want to render the website after a push to the main branch.\n\nSet up renv\nIn order to render the website as a github action, we need to define the R package dependencies that are required to run the code. For us, that would be among others ggplot, pheatmap, babynames and others. To conveniently handle this, we use the package renv, which basically looks for packages you are using in your project and creates an environment definition file (called renv.lock) based on which packages it finds.\nTo set up renv for you project, run the following:\ninstall.packages(\"renv\")\nrenv::init()\nrenv::snapshot()\nHere, init will initiate renv in your project by creating the required files, among which renv.lock. The function snapshot will create a snapshot of your current project dependencies and add it to renv.lock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nAfter running renv::init() and renv::snapshot() see what is in renv.lock and commit the changes of your repository to the main branch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe file renv.lock is a json file containing all package metadata. To add it to your repository:\ngit checkout main\ngit add --all\ngit commit -m \"set up renv\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDefine the GitHub action\nNow that we have defined the required dependencies, we can define the action. We will provide you with a template for this:\nname: Quarto Publish\n\n# the on statement tells github actions whnen to run the action\non:\n  # pushing to main\n  push:\n    branches: main\n    \n# set permissions so the actions in the workflow can write files to your repository\npermissions: write-all\n\n# define the job\njobs:\n  # we name it quarto-deploy\n  quarto-deploy:\n    # define the virtual environment\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    # the steps are the individual actions that are needed to complete the job\n\n    steps:\n        \n        # first step is check out the repository so we have access to the files\n        # inside the repository in our virtual environment\n      - name: Check out repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n        \n        # now we install quarto in the environment\n      - name: Set up Quarto\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2\n        \n        # we also install R\n      - name: Install R\n        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2\n        with:\n          # ! important: change this version to your local R version \n          # i.e. the version that is specified in renv.lock\n          r-version: '4.3.1'\n\n        # and the required R dependencies\n      - name: Install R Dependencies\n        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-renv@v2\n        with:\n          cache-version: 1\n\n        # now we use a pre-created action to basically run \n        # quarto publish gh-pages\n      - name: Render and Publish\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2\n        with:\n          target: gh-pages\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\nCompare the version of R that is installed on your local machine with the one specified in the yaml file. Update it to the version that you have locally installed (and is specified in renv.lock). Store the file in your repository as .github/workflows/quarto-publish.yml. Also add and commit this file to you repository with:\ngit add .github/workflows/quarto-publish.yml\ngit commit -m \"adds action yaml\"\nNow, we‚Äôre ready to push and with that trigger the run of our first action. Go ahead and push the commits to remote repository with:\ngit push\nAfter pushing, go to the Actions tab in your repository on GitHub. You should see a new action running named ‚ÄòQuarto Publish‚Äô. After it finishes, you can check out the rendered website, which will be hosted on USER.github.io/REPOSITORY.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis will take a while, because all packages need to be compiled.\n\n\nFrom now on, every time you push to main, the action will run and the website will be updated."

    "text": "Course description\nThe FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) principles provide guidelines for making research data and other resources more easily discoverable and reusable, which can help increase your research‚Äôs impact and exposure. Adhering to these principles also ensures that your research is more reliable and reproducible, as others can more easily access and provide feedback. In addition, making your research FAIR can promote the principles of open science and make it easier for others to contribute to and build upon your work. Finally, many funding agencies and journals now expect that your research outputs be made FAIR as a condition of funding or publication, so adhering to these principles can help to ensure that your research meets these requirements.\nSharing and reusing are at the heart of the FAIR principles and should be a routine task of any (life) scientist today. To enable others to use or reproduce our findings and work, we need to provide all the information: the data, software and parameters used, scripts for the analysis, databases and their versions, and any required documentation and contextualisation. To have all this information and code together in a single file, many use markdown. Such a markdown file can be created in a simple way, and after that rendered in a single web page that is easy to share and read.\nThe FAIR principles are a continuum of steps, and FAIRrer research is better than not FAIR at all. In this tutorial, the participants will be introduced to some FAIR steps. They will learn how to write documentation containing Markdown and code (e.g.¬†R or Python) and render it into nicely formatted pages with Quarto. Afterwards, the participants will learn the basics of git and GitHub and how to host the version-controlled source files in a GitHub repository. Third, the participants will learn how to automatically render the source files into a nicely formatted web page hosted with GitHub. Lastly, the participant will learn how to store the source files in a longer term by linking a GitHub repository to Zenodo and giving it a unique identifier (DOI).\nBy using the taught tools and concepts, the participants will take significant steps in adhering to the FAIR principles and therefore boost the benefits of sharing."

Interesting! Let's have a look at the boys names:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-line-boys\n#| fig-cap: \"Line plot displaying proportion of top 10 boy names by year\"\nget_most_frequent(babynames, select_sex = \"M\") |&gt;\n  plot_top()\n```\n\n@fig-line-boys shows that names that were popular before 1990 are relatively infrequent after 2000."

    "section": "Extra: quarto extension and webassembly",
    "text": "Extra: quarto extension and webassembly\nQuarto offers the possiblity to personnalise and extend its base capability with extensions built by the quarto community.\nThese include extra fonts and emojis, additionnal document template (like scientific journal template), extra graphical components (like the accordion ).\nExtensions can be installed with the terminal command:\nquarto add EXTENSIONNAME\nThe extension will be installed in _extensions/ folder.\nNote that extension are specific to a quarto project, meaning that they need to be installed separately for each project. This may sound tedious, but in practice it makes sharing and automatically building websites or documents with these extensions easier.\nLet‚Äôs try it with an extension that extends quarto with webassembly components for python and R: quarto-live.\n\nquarto-live : web assembly for ‚Äúfree‚Äù interactive computing\nUsing web-assembly, we can have python or R code executed on the fly in the browser. In quarto, this can be achieved with the quarto-live extension.\nThis is very nice as it lets you build fully interactive app without the need to host them with a server architecture (because all the computations happen on the user‚Äôs computer), which lets us host it as a static website (potentially for free, as for our github page!).\nOf course there is a downside: upon loading the page, the user‚Äôs browser will need to install all the R webassembly components and associated libraries. This generally takes around 10 to 30 seconds if you don‚Äôt have many complex libraries. Also, the execution of the R or python code is often a bit slower than what you would experience outside the web browser.\n\nWe start by installing the extension.\nIn the terminal, navigate to your quarto project folder and type:\nquarto add r-wasm/quarto-live\nThe command will ask you to type ‚ÄúY‚Äù and press Enter in order to validate the installation.\nThen, you can start adding webassembly components in your qmd files.\nFor example, try adding a new file interactive_compute.qmd\n\nthis example is heavily inspired by this page.\n\nWe start the page by the yaml preamble:\n---\ntitle: Interactive work without a server with web assembly\nformat: live-html\nengine: knitr\n---\n\n{{&lt; include ./_extensions/r-wasm/live/_knitr.qmd &gt;}}\nNote here the format: live-html, and engine: knitr. The first marks the document as a live document (that uses quarto-live), and the second set the rendering engine (the alternative is engine: jupyter, which requires a python installation).\nThe last line is required if you use the knitr rendering engine. According to the extension documentation in the future it will not be needed anymore, but for now we have to include it.\nThen, you can (finally) start adding some code:\n\n```{webr}\n#| output: false\n#| echo: FALSE\n#| edit: false\n#| autorun: true\nlibrary(babynames)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(magrittr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n\nHistogram interacting with a javascript [Observable input](https://github.com/observablehq/inputs?tab=readme-ov-file) component:\n\n```{ojs}\n//| echo: false\nviewof sex_box = Inputs.checkbox(\n  [\"M\", \"F\"],\n  {\n    value: [\"M\", \"F\"],\n    label: \"Shown sexes:\",\n  }\n)\n```\n\n```{webr}\n#| echo: FALSE\n#| edit: false\n#| autorun: true\n#| input:\n#|   - sex_box\n\nnbins = 100\ndata = babynames %&gt;% filter( sex %in% sex_box  )\n\nggplot( data , aes(x=n , fill = sex) ) + geom_histogram(bins = nbins) + scale_x_log10()\n```\nYou can note that the code cells types are different:\n\n{webr} : contains R that will be in web-assembly: rather than being executed once during the html rendering, they will be executed live in the browser.\n{ojs} : Observable javascript - we use these cells to include interactive javascript input/outputs\n\nAlso, in addition to the base quarto chunk options, we see:\n\n//| in {ojs} cells, because javascript comments start with // rather than #\n#| edit: : make a cell editable or not\n#| autorun: true : when true the cell is automatically executed at startup and whenever its content is changed.\n\nAnd importantly:\n#| input:\n#|   - sex_box\nThis tells R to go grab a javascript variable we defined with viewof in another {ojs} block.\nFrom there, even more components can be added to create the interactive plot of dashboard of your choice:\n```{webr}\n#| echo: false\n#| edit: false\n#| autorun: true\n\nget_most_frequent &lt;- function(babynames, select_sex, from = 1950) {\n  most_freq &lt;- babynames |&gt;\n    filter(sex == select_sex, year &gt; from) |&gt;\n    group_by(name) |&gt;\n    summarise(average = mean(prop)) |&gt;\n    arrange(desc(average))\n    \n  return(list(\n    babynames = babynames,\n    most_frequent = most_freq,\n    sex = select_sex,\n    from = from))\n}\n\nplot_top &lt;- function(x, top = 10) {\n  topx &lt;- x$most_frequent$name[1:top]\n  \n  p &lt;- x$babynames |&gt;\n    filter(name %in% topx, sex == x$sex, year &gt; x$from) |&gt;\n    ggplot(aes(x = year, y = prop, color = name)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Paired\") +\n    theme_classic()\n  \n  return(p)\n}\n```\n\n\nA more complex examples with more interactive inputs (NB: it seems that when moving the slider the image get re-computed for each intermediate value, leading to some slowness sometimes)  :\n```{webr}\n#| echo: FALSE\n#| edit: false\n#| autorun: true\n#| input:\n#|   - sex_show\n#|   - year\n#|   - n_names\n\nget_most_frequent(babynames, select_sex = sex_show , from = year ) |&gt;\n  plot_top(top=n_names)\n\n```\n\n\n```{ojs}\n//| echo: false\nviewof sex_show = Inputs.radio([\"M\", \"F\"], {label: \"Sex:\",value:\"F\"})\n\nviewof year = Inputs.range([1880, 2010], {step: 10, label: \"starting year:\"})\n\nviewof n_names = Inputs.range([1, 12], {step: 1, label: \"number of top names:\"})\n```\n\nYou can also just have interactive R/python cells where you can write and execute code :\n```{webr}\nfor (x in 1:5) {\n  print(x ** 2)\n}\n```"
